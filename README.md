# MedFocusCLIP: Improving Few-Shot Classification in Medical Datasets

**MedFocusCLIP** leverages the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) to improve few-shot classification on medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans. By combining segmentation with multimodal vision-language models, MedFocusCLIP enhances the modelâ€™s ability to identify critical regions in medical images with limited labeled data.

## Features
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Efficiently classifies medical images with minimal labeled data.
- **Advanced Segmentation**: Utilizes SAM2 to localize important regions in medical images.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Demonstrates higher performance than standard models across multiple medical datasets.

## Images

Below are some key visuals from the paper demonstrating MedFocusCLIP in action:

### MedFocusCLIP Framework

This figure illustrates how SAM2 segments the medical image, and CLIP's image encoder processes it using a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, improving classification performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

### Performance Comparison on COVID-19 Dataset

This figure shows the performance of MedFocusCLIP compared to other models, demonstrating superior accuracy, especially with smaller datasets.

### Masked Image Examples from Breast Cancer Dataset

The image on the left is generated by SAM2, and the one on the right is generated by the SAM Adapter. MedFocusCLIP significantly outperforms other models when using SAM2's mask segmentation.

## Datasets
MedFocusCLIP has been evaluated on a variety of medical datasets:
